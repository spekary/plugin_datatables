	/**
	 * Generated QDataTableGen class.
	 * 
	 * This is the QDataTableGen class which is automatically generated
	 * by scraping the JQuery UI documentation website. As such, it includes all the options
	 * as listed by the JQuery UI website, which may or may not be appropriate for QCubed. See
	 * the QDataTableBase class for any glue code to make this class more
	 * usable in QCubed.
	 * 
	 * @see QDataTableBase
	 * @package Controls\Base
	 * @property boolean $AutoWidth
	 * Enable or disable automatic column width calculation. This can be
	 * disabled as an optimisation (it takes a finite amount of time to
	 * calculate the widths) if the tables widths are passed in using
	 * columns.widthDT.
	 *
	 * @property boolean $DeferRender
	 * By default, when DataTables loads data from an Ajax or Javascript data
	 * source (ajaxDT and dataDT respectively) it will create all HTML
	 * elements needed up-front. When working with large data sets, this
	 * operation can take a not-insignificant amount of time, particularly in
	 * older browsers such as IE6-8. This option allows DataTables to create
	 * the nodes (rows and cells in the table body) only when they are needed
	 * for a draw.
	 *
	 * @property boolean $Info
	 * When this option is enabled, Datatables will show information about
	 * the table including information about filtered data if that action is
	 * being performed. This option allows that feature to be enabled or
	 * disabled.
	 *
	 * @property boolean $JQueryUI
	 * DataTables can be styled by a number of CSS library packages, included
	 * jQuery UI, Twitter Bootstrap and Foundation. Although Bootstrap,
	 * Foundation and other libraries require a plug-in, jQuery UI
	 * ThemeRoller support is built into DataTables and can be enabled simply
	 * with this parameter. When enabled, DataTables will use markup and
	 * classes created for jQuery UI ThemeRoller, making it very easy to
	 * integrate your tables with jQuery UI.
	 *
	 * @property boolean $LengthChange
	 * When pagination is enabled, this option will control the display an
	 * option for the end user to change number of records to be shown per
	 * page. The options shown in the list are controlled by the lengthMenuDT
	 * configuration option.
	 *
	 * @property boolean $Ordering
	 * Enable or disable ordering of columns - it is as simple as that!
	 * DataTables, by default, allows end users to click on the header cell
	 * for each column, ordering the table by the data in that column. The
	 * ability to order data can be disabled using this option.
	 *
	 * @property boolean $Paging
	 * DataTables can split the rows in tables into individual pages, which
	 * is an efficient method of showing a large number of records in a small
	 * space. The end user is provided with controls to request the display
	 * of different data as the navigate through the data. This feature is
	 * enabled by default, but if you wish to disable it, you may do so with
	 * this parameter.
	 *
	 * @property boolean $Processing
	 * Enable or disable the display of a 'processing' indicator when the
	 * table is being processed (e.g. a sort). This is particularly useful
	 * for tables with large amounts of data where it can take a noticeable
	 * amount of time to sort the entries.
	 *
	 * @property boolean $ScrollX
	 * Enable horizontal scrolling. When a table is too wide to fit into a
	 * certain layout, or you have a large number of columns in the table,
	 * you can enable horizontal (x) scrolling to show the table in a
	 * viewport, which can be scrolled.
	 *
	 * @property string $ScrollY
	 * Enable vertical scrolling. Vertical scrolling will constrain the
	 * DataTable to the given height, and enable scrolling for any data which
	 * overflows the current viewport. This can be used as an alternative to
	 * paging to display a lot of data in a small area (although paging and
	 * scrolling can both be enabled at the same time if desired).
	 *
	 * @property boolean $Searching
	 * This option allows the search abilities of DataTables to be enabled or
	 * disabled. Searching in DataTables is "smart" in that it allows the end
	 * user to input multiple words (space separated) and will match a row
	 * containing those words, even if not in the order that was specified
	 * (this allow matching across multiple columns).
	 *
	 * @property boolean $ServerSide
	 * DataTables has two fundamental modes of operation:
	 *
	 * @property boolean $StateSave
	 * Enable or disable state saving. When enabled aDataTables will storage
	 * state information such as pagination position, display length,
	 * filtering and sorting. When the end user reloads the page the table's
	 * state will be altered to match what they had previously set up.
	 *
	 * @property mixed $Ajax
	 * DataTables can obtain the data that it is to display in the table body
	 * from a number of sources, including from an Ajax data source, using
	 * this initialisation parameter. As with other dynamic data sources,
	 * arrays or objects can be used for the data source for each row, with
	 * columns.dataDT employed to read from specific object properties.
	 *
	 * @property array $Data
	 * DataTables can obtain the data it is to display in the table's body
	 * from a number of sources, including being passed in as an array of row
	 * data using this initialisation parameter. As with other dynamic data
	 * sources, arrays or objects can be used for the data source for each
	 * row, with columns.dataDT employed to read from specific object
	 * properties.
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $CreatedRow
	 * This callback is executed when a TR element is created (and all TD
	 * child elements have been inserted), or registered if using a DOM
	 * source, allowing manipulation of the TR element.
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $DrawCallback
	 * It can be useful to take an action on every draw event of the table -
	 * for example you might want to update an external control with the
	 * newly displayed data, or with server-side processing is enabled you
	 * might want to assign events to the newly created elements. This
	 * callback is designed for exactly that purpose and will execute on
	 * every draw.
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $FooterCallback
	 * Identical to headerCallbackDT but for the table footer this function
	 * allows you to modify the table footer on every 'draw' event.
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $FormatNumber
	 * DataTables will display numbers in a few different locations when
	 * drawing information about a table, for example in the table's
	 * information element and the pagination controls. When working with
	 * large numbers it is often useful to format it for readability by
	 * separating the thousand units - for example 1 million is rendered as
	 * "1,000,000", allowing the user to see at a glance what order of
	 * magnitude the number shows.
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $HeaderCallback
	 * This function is called on every 'draw' event (i.e. when a filter,
	 * sort or page event is initiated by the end user or the API), and
	 * allows you to dynamically modify the header row. This can be used to
	 * calculate and display useful information about the table.
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $InfoCallback
	 * The information element can be used to convey information about the
	 * current state of the table. Although the internationalisation options
	 * presented by DataTables are quite capable of dealing with most
	 * customisations, there may be times where you wish to customise the
	 * string further. This callback allows you to do exactly that.
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $InitComplete
	 * It can often be useful to know when your table has fully been
	 * initialised, data loaded and drawn, particularly when using an ajaxDT
	 * data source. In such a case, the table will complete its initial run
	 * before the data has been loaded (Ajax is asynchronous after all!) so
	 * this callback is provided to let you know when the data is fully
	 * loaded.
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $PreDrawCallback
	 * The partner of the drawCallbackDT callback, this function is called at
	 * the very start of each table draw. It can therefore be used to update
	 * or clean the display before each draw (for example removing events),
	 * and additionally can be used to cancel the draw by returning false.
	 * Any other return (including undefined) results in the full draw
	 * occurring.
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $RowCallback
	 * This callback allows you to 'post process' each row after it have been
	 * generated for each table draw, but before it is rendered into the
	 * document. This means that the contents of the row might not have
	 * dimensions ($().width() for example) if it is not already in the
	 * document.
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $StateLoadCallback
	 * With this callback you can define where, and how, the state of a table
	 * is loaded from. By default DataTables will load from localStorage but
	 * you might wish to use a server-side database or cookies as your
	 * implementation requirements demand. For the format of the data that is
	 * stored, please refer to the stateSaveCallbackDT documentation.
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $StateLoaded
	 * Callback that is fired once the state has been loaded
	 * (stateLoadCallbackDT) and the saved data manipulated (if required -
	 * stateLoadParamsDT).
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $StateLoadParams
	 * Callback which allows modification of the saved state prior to loading
	 * that state. This callback is called when the table is loading state
	 * from the stored data, but prior to the settings object being modified
	 * by the saved state.
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $StateSaveCallback
	 * DataTables can save the state of the table (paging, filtering etc)
	 * when the stateSaveDT option is enabled, and by default it will use
	 * HTML5's localStorage to save the state into. This callback method
	 * allows you to change where the state is saved (for example you might
	 * wish to use a server-side database or cookies).
	 *
	 * @property QJsClosure $StateSaveParams
	 * Callback which allows modification of the parameters to be saved for
	 * the DataTables state saving (stateSaveDT), prior to the data actually
	 * being saved. This callback is called every time DataTables requests
	 * that the state be saved. For the format of the data that is stored,
	 * please refer to the stateSaveCallbackDT documentation.
	 *
	 * @property mixed $DeferLoading
	 * When using server-side processing, the default mode of operation for
	 * DataTables is to simply throw away any data that currently exists in
	 * the table and make a request to the server to get the first page of
	 * data to display. This is fine for an empty table, but if you already
	 * have the first page of data displayed in the plain HTML, it is a waste
	 * of resources. As such, this option exists to allow you to instruct
	 * DataTables to not make that initial request, rather it will use the
	 * data already on the page (no sorting etc will be applied to it).
	 *
	 * @property boolean $Destroy
	 * Initialise a new DataTable as usual, but if there is an existing
	 * DataTable which matches the selector, it will be destroyed and
	 * replaced with the new table. This can be useful if you want to change
	 * a property of the table which cannot be altered through the API.
	 *
	 * @property integer $DisplayStart
	 * Define the starting point for data display when using DataTables with
	 * pagination (paginateDT).
	 *
	 * @property string $Dom
	 * DataTables will add a number of elements around the table to both
	 * control the table and show additional information about it. The
	 * position of these elements on screen are controlled by a combination
	 * of their order in the document (DOM) and the CSS applied to the
	 * elements. This parameter is used to control their ordering and
	 * additional mark-up surrounding them in the DOM.
	 *
	 * @property array $LengthMenu
	 * This parameter allows you to readily specify the entries in the length
	 * drop down select list that DataTables shows when pagination is
	 * enabled. It can be either:
	 *
	 * @property array $Order
	 * If ordering is enabled (orderingDT), then DataTables will perform a
	 * first pass order during initialisation. Using this parameter you can
	 * define which column(s) the order is performed upon, and the ordering
	 * direction. The orderDT must be an array of arrays, each inner array
	 * comprised of two elements:
	 *
	 * @property boolean $OrderCellsTop
	 * Allows control over whether DataTables should use the top (true)
	 * unique cell that is found for a single column, or the bottom (false -
	 * default) to attach the default order listener. This is useful when
	 * using complex headers.
	 *
	 * @property boolean $OrderClasses
	 * DataTables highlight the columns which are used to order the content
	 * in the table's body by adding a class to the cells in that column,
	 * which in turn has CSS applied to those classes to highlight those
	 * cells.
	 *
	 * @property mixed $OrderFixed
	 * The option works in tandem with the orderDT option which provides an
	 * initial ordering state for the table which can then be modified by the
	 * user clicking on column headings, while the ordering specified by this
	 * option will always be applied to the table, regardless of user
	 * interaction.
	 *
	 * @property boolean $OrderMulti
	 * When ordering is enabled (orderingDT), by default DataTables allows
	 * users to sort multiple columns by shift clicking upon the header cell
	 * for each column. Although this can be quite useful for users, it can
	 * also increase the complexity of the order, potentiality increasing the
	 * processing time of ordering the data. Therefore, this option is
	 * provided to allow this shift-click multiple column ability.
	 *
	 * @property integer $PageLength
	 * Number of rows to display on a single page when using pagination.
	 *
	 * @property string $PagingType
	 * The pagination option of DataTables will display a pagination control
	 * below the table (by default, its position can be changed using domDT
	 * and CSS) with buttons that the end user can use to navigate the pages
	 * of the table. Which buttons are shown in the pagination control are
	 * defined by the option given here.
	 *
	 * @property mixed $Renderer
	 * DataTables adds some complex components to your HTML page, such as the
	 * pagination control. The business logic used to calculate information
	 * should be displayed (what buttons in the case of the pagination
	 * buttons) is core to DataTables and generally doesn't vary how the
	 * buttons are actually displayed does based on the styling requirements
	 * of the page. For example the pagination buttons might be displayed as
	 * li elements in a ul list, or simply as a collection of a buttons.
	 *
	 * @property boolean $Retrieve
	 * Retrieve the DataTables object for the given selector. Note that if
	 * the table has already been initialised, this parameter will cause
	 * DataTables to simply return the object that has already been set up -
	 * it will not take account of any changes you might have made to the
	 * initialisation object passed to DataTables (setting this parameter to
	 * true is an acknowledgement that you understand this!).
	 *
	 * @property boolean $ScrollCollapse
	 * When vertical (y) scrolling is enabled through the use of the
	 * scrollYDT option, DataTables will force the height of the table's
	 * viewport to the given height at all times (useful for layout).
	 * However, this can look odd when filtering data down to a small data
	 * set, and the footer is left "floating" further down. This parameter
	 * (when enabled) will cause DataTables to collapse the table's viewport
	 * down when the result set will fit within the given Y height.
	 *
	 * @property mixed $Search
	 * The searchDT option allows the way DataTables performs filtering to be
	 * set during the initialisation, and to set an initial global filter.
	 *
	 * @property array $SearchCols
	 * Basically the same as the searchDT option, but in this case for
	 * individual columns, rather than the global filter, this option defined
	 * the filtering to apply to the table during initialisation.
	 *
	 * @property integer $SearchDelay
	 * The built in DataTables global search (by default at the top right of
	 * every DataTable)will instantly search the table on every keypress when
	 * in client-side processing mode and reduce the search call frequency
	 * automatically to 400mS when in server-side processing mode. This call
	 * frequency (throttling) can be controlled using the searchDelayDT
	 * parameter for both client-side and server-side processing.
	 *
	 * @property integer $StateDuration
	 * Duration for which the saved state information is considered valid.
	 * After this period has elapsed the state will be returned to the
	 * default.
	 *
	 * @property array $StripeClasses
	 * An array of CSS classes that should be applied to displayed rows, in
	 * sequence. This array may be of any length, and DataTables will apply
	 * each class sequentially, looping when required.
	 *
	 * @property integer $TabIndex
	 * By default DataTables allows keyboard navigation of the table
	 * (sorting, paging, and filtering) by adding a tabindex attribute to the
	 * required elements. This allows the end user to tab through the
	 * controls and press the enter key to activate them, allowing the table
	 * controls to be accessible without a mouse.
	 *
	 * @property array $ColumnDefs
	 * Very similar to columnsDT, this parameter allows you to assign
	 * specific options to columns in the table, although in this case the
	 * column options defined can be applied to one or more columns.
	 * Additionally, not every column need be specified, unlike columnsDT.
	 *
	 * @property array $Columns
	 * The columnsDT option in the initialisation parameter allows you to
	 * define details about the way individual columns behave. For a full
	 * list of column options that can be set, please see the related
	 * parameters below.
	 *
	 * @property mixed $Language
	 * All strings that DataTables uses in its user interface are defined in
	 * this object, allowing you to modified them individually or completely
	 * replace them all as required. This ensures that DataTables is fully
	 * internationalisable as strings for any language can be used.
	 *
